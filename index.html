                                You'll do everything from checking off deliveries to dealing with enquiries or ensuring that the shelves are fully 
                                stocked with well-presented products. And, of course, you'll provide excellent customer service at all times by 
                                attending to customer needs in a prompt and friendly way. It's a really fast-paced environment, 
                                and everyone understands exactly what needs to happen to 
                                make their store a success – and gets on with doing it. There's a real family feel here, and we all

                                A franchised restaurant is a restaurant operated by a local business person 
                                trading under the McDonald's name. Currently over 80% of our restaurants in the
                                 UK are franchised but from a customer point of view there's no difference. For
                                  employees there will be minor differences between a company and a franchised restaurant.
