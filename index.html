                                you'll never find yourself bored and twiddling your thumbs on the till as a Store Assistant. In fact, time will fly by.

                                You'll do everything from checking off deliveries to dealing with enquiries or ensuring that the shelves are fully 
                                stocked with well-presented products. And, of course, you'll provide excellent customer service at all times by 
                                attending to customer needs in a prompt and friendly way. It's a really fast-paced environment, and everyone understands exactly what needs to happen to 
                                make their store a success – and gets on with doing it. There's a real family feel here, and we all pitch in as part of a close-knit team.
